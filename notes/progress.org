* Type Classes

    Frontend -> Core (where typeclasses would be handled) -> Typechecker?
    Or would it be Frontend -> TypeChecker -> Compiler handles the classes?

* Displaying Errors
  - Note taken on [2019-11-01 Fri 02:49] \\
    Since the typechecker has access to the full tree at the top level,
    it should be straightforward to pass up errors and annotate them?

    I'm not sure how I could relate that to a line and position number,
    though.  The only way might be extending the frontend language
    definition.
